# Cloud Samples
This repo is my collection of hands-on demos and projects for cloud automation, provisioning, scripting, and administration. 
I use tools like Terraform for infrastructure as code, Ansible for configuration management, Bash for quick scripts,
and Python for more complex automation—all across major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and others.

## What's Inside?

Each subdirectory (like 0x01, 0x02, etc.) is a self-contained project or demo.
